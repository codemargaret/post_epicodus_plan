## Capstone
_To see my progress on my capstone, please visit [this repository](https://github.com/codemargaret/IntervYou.git)._

## Goals

# High Priority
* _Attend Ruby Brigade and Epicodus Alumnae Meetups every month._
* _Sign up for a mentor through the Women in Tech mentorship program._
* _Make a spreadsheet of tech companies I'm interested in working for and follow them on LinkedIn._
* _Write LinkedIn recommendations for my classmates._
* _Create basic READMEs for all daily projects from the Ruby, JavaScript, and Rails classes. (I've done this for Intro already)._
* _Complete the Udemy React course._
* _Add both a React and an Angular front end to the Rails API I've created for my capstone._
* _Connect with local Computer Science alumnae from my undergraduate college._

# Medium Priority
* _Complete the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification, particularly the section on JavaScript algorithms._
* _Continue building out the Rails portfolio that I started for my code review._
* _Practice answering at least 5 of Epicodus' technical interview practice questions aloud per week._
* _Refactor my Galactic Calculator project to get rid of the code smell._
* _Learn to use modules in Ruby._
* _For my Snowflake Scheduler team week project, add the future features outlined in the README._

# Low Priority
* _Add integration testing to my Rails shopping app._
* _Build out a personal web page for my music._
* _Complete Code Academy's Sass course._
* _Add Sass to my Craigslist re-creation project._
* _Contribute another pull request to the Mozilla VoiceWeb repository._
* _Complete one challenge on Code Fights per week._
* _Write some tutorials for incoming Epicodus students, with the goal of better understanding the material myself._

## Action Plan
_Before I came to Epicodus, I was committed to being a lifelong learner. I'm very excited to have found a field in which I will always be learning new things, and be challenged on a daily basis. While prioritizing my goals, it became clear to me that my current focus is on finding an environment where I can continue this learning. My high-priority goals are to connect with people in order to find a job, and to build out my main capstone project to showcase my abilities. My medium-priority goals are centered around improving my technical Ruby and JavaScript skills. I want to continue to work to be a full-stack developer, so my low-priority goals include some additional skills and personal projects._
